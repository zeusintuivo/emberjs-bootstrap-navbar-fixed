Ember 1.9.1 && BootStrap 3.3.2 Fixed Top Navbar Starter Kit
==========

######(Made on Feb, Saturday the 7th, 2015) 


####This is just a starter kit for Ember with BootStrap included. 
####It has the regular Ember.js Starter kit which included:

- Start writing your app in `js/app.js`.

- Describe your application HTML in `index.html`.

- During development, you can link to `js/libs/ember-*.js` to get the
  unminified version of Ember.js.

- Add CSS to `css/style.css`.

- Open `index.html` in your browser.

####It also includes the Fixed TOP Navigation Bar from Bootstrap:
  
  - bootrap
  - theme
  
#### Just out of the box to keep doing a simple website, that 
#### has EmberJS. So, perhaps it could be a starting point for an app.   

Tests
=====

This starter kit comes with an integration test sample, written for QUnit runner. 

You can run the tests by opening the `index.html?test` page in your browser.

integration test should be written, using QUnit assertions and ember-testing helpers.
